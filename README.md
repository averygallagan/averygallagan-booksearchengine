# averygallagan-booksearchengine
week 21 Book Search Engine

This week we were tasked with taking an already functioning application and updating it using apollo and graphQL. This application is a book searching engine with book saving capability. It uses the MERN stack which includes MongoDB, Espress, React, and Node. 

To start this app, a user must do an npm i and then an npm run develop in the root directory.
